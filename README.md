## Discuss one challenge you overcame during your academic development. What was the challenge, was it technical, nontechnical, or both, and how did you overcome it?

Throughout my education, I have developed a unique set of skills and strategies that have allowed me to overcome various challenges. From managing a heavy workload to finding creative solutions to complex problems, I have found ways to adapt to new situations and overcome demanding environments. However, none of these challenges compare to my lifelong obstacle: ADHD. Starting in elementary school, there was an obvious issue. I had a good grasp of certain topics and no recollection of others. No one could understand why. It would take me until my freshman year of high school to get an official diagnosis, but I had known long before that. I had ADHD. Since this is a characteristic of mine, the challenge is nontechnical. When I would take 50-question exams as a kid, I have clear memories of just giving up and bubbling in answers randomly. This was not out of incompetence, it was out of boredom. As I grew older, I would come up with ways to cure this boredom and make doing a repetitive task not as painful. As I would take the test I would keep track of the numbers of A’s B’s C’s and D’s and see which letter would win. It was usually a pretty intense battle between B and C. As my schoolwork got more difficult, I would see more and more of how ADHD affected me. Homework was pretty much impossible for me until college, I could only start working on something if it was two hours before the due date, and zoning out during the most important part of a lecture was a guarantee. In college things started to click for me, I gained a better understanding of what I needed to do in order to succeed and had the motivation to make those changes. I researched ways that people in similar situations were able to overcome their challenges. I realized that I needed a strict routine for myself in order to accomplish goals that were trivial to most. I started to set deadlines for myself instead of using the assignment's deadline. Most of all I realized that I can only learn at my best when I have a strong interest in the subject and am sufficiently challenged. This led to me choosing my major in cybersecurity and finally being able to set good school standards for myself. In conclusion, although I faced many challenges in my time at school, the one that’s been around the longest and taught me the most by far was ADHD. Not only have I learned how to overcome this challenge in an academic environment, but I have learned to see my trait as a blessing and not a curse. Because of ADHD, I am able to pursue the things I am interested in with much more passion and drive, and I am always seeking challenging and rewarding activities. Overall, this challenge was one that ended up setting me down the right path and has given me the courage to handle any obstacle thrown my way.
